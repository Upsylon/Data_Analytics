```{r}
cred <- read.csv2("GermanCredit.csv")
cred <- data.frame(cred)
```


```{r}
nrows<-nrow(cred)
n.missing<-rowSums(is.na(cred))
sum(n.missing)
```
As the sum of the missing values is equal to 0, we can deduce that we have no missing value in the GermanCredit file.

```{r}
table(cred$HISTORY)
```

```{r}

for(i in 1:32){print(table(cred[,i]))}
```
